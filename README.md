## Description

The project contains _data_ and _represtation logic_ to create a live resumé.  
The core is the [curriculum-vitea](./Curriculum_vitae.json) data file, which can be easily updated.  
A non-technical represtation of this data is pusblished via github-pages tranforming the json data to html with some javascript.

## Objective

Creating a resume that allows people to look beyond the facade, exposing everything that was done.  
Enabling people to see which shortcuts were taken, what kind of solutions were used for specific problems and what's over/under engineered.  
This also makes it possible to look into the evolution of the resume (unless I opted to rewrite the git history :innocent:).

## Todo

As with any hobby project, the items on this list will likely never be finished

- add unit tests for the javasript html redering
- created interactive "sticky" board represtation (not javascript)

## Sidenotes

Giving lightning talks about this project has inspired people to reavalute the format of their own resumé.
